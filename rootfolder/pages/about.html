            <h3>Hello! The Hats Online team doesn't have many members, so we're definitely looking for some. Currently, the owners of the team are rstride and Anceptical.</h3>

            <p>The one who started it all! He takes nothing seriously, is a time piece person and if you couldn't tell, likes A Hat In Time. A lot. Like it's his favorite game. Originally, he didn't really take all this Hats Online thing too seriously, then I came in and was all of a sudden like "website" and now this happened lol</p>

            <p>The website designer! If it's written anywhere in 1st person it's him talking. Unlike Anceptical, he typically takes thing a bit more seriously. His favorite game is Undertale which can be figured out by his Storyshift Chara profile picture and Sans addiction.</p>
