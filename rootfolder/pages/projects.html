    <h1>Our Projects!</h1>
    
    <h3>The Hats Online team isn't here to do one thing. We're here to do everything about hats! As the main page says, we're going to make games, art, actual real life hats, even! All of these types of projects will be listed here for you to see, with all the info about them you might need!</h3>
        
        <h2>Making the website!</h2>
        
            <p>Our first and currently only project is finishing this website with everything needed! Chances are, it's already done now, when you're here reading. We're making all the pages, giving it a domain, polishing it and everything in between!</p>
        
        <h2>Planned projects!</h2>
        
            <p>We have quite a bit planned for the future, but the most notable project we want to be a thing is a ROBLOX game all about hats! We're still learning how to really make scripted games, which could mean that it could take a long time for anything, well, actually good to come out of all this.</p>
