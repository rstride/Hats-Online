	<h1>Welcome to Hats Online!</h1>

	<h3>What is Hats Online, you may ask? Well, we are a group dedicated to hats! Originating on ROBLOX, Hats Online is doing all kinds of hat-related stuff: Art, games, maybe we'll even make real hats of our own at some point! Hats Online is owned by 2 people: rstride, the designer of the website and Anceptical, the one who started it all! We, well, like hats. Obviously. We're down to recruit any other hat fans to help us become the biggest hat group on the internet! No matter how you think you could contribute, you have a chance of being with us!</h3>

	<h3>Well, that's about it! Make sure to also join our ROBLOX group, which doesn't yet exist but I swear it will soon!</h3>
